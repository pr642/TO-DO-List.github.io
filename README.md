# TO-DO-List.github.io
I have created a To-Do List application, using HTML,CSS, Vanilla Javascript.
Key Features:

1) Add Task: Users can enter a task in the provided text box at the top of the app and click the "Add" button to add it to the todo list.
2) Todo List: The entered tasks are displayed as a list below the input section. Each task is accompanied by a checkbox, allowing users to mark tasks as completed.
3) Mark as Completed: To mark a task as completed, users can click the checkbox next to the task. Completed tasks will have a strikethrough effect and a different color, making them visually distinct from uncompleted tasks.
   
4) Delete Task: If users want to remove a task from the list, they can click the "Delete" button next to that task, and it will be removed completely.
5) Total Tasks Count: At the bottom of the app, the total number of tasks in the list is displayed, helping users keep track of the number of tasks they have to complete.

6) Animation: Whenever a new task is added to the list, it comes with a "Smooth Slide-in Animation", enhancing the user experience.

7) Persistence: The app utilizes Local Storage to save the todo list data, ensuring that the tasks remain saved even when the browser is closed or refreshed.

# Adding tasks on the Application
As, soon as the user adds the tasks the counter will also increase, to reflect that how many tasks are present in the list.
